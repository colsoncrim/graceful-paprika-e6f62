I'm a jamstack developer living and working in the Seattle metro area. I use modern technologies to create blazing fast websites that scale with ease, and are very maintainable.

## Credentials

I've been working in software development for the last two years at a fin-tech startup here in Seattle. This has provided a solid foundation of understanding in the world of tech, and has taught me how to develop a product the right way.

On my own time, I became interested in leveraging new frameworks and tools to create modern interfaces for businesses.



## Coding for Action

I believe that each and every piece of writing should inspire an action that is connected to a tangible business goal. I will work with you to define our content KPIs, understand how to properly track and measure them, and hit our goals by creating effective messaging across all of your digital assets.
